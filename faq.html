                <p>The Copic brand was founded by the Too Group in Tokyo, Japan in 1987 and it all started with the
                    launch
                    of our professional quality alcohol-based graphic markers that can now be found in over 70
                    countries.
                    Today Copic consists of 3 marker ranges and 358 colors and the brand is greatly appreciated for the
                    high
                    quality standards and long-lasting properties, all markers are refillable and worn nibs can be
                    replaced.
                    In addition, Copic carries other products and accessories such as a multiliners, premium paper,
                    sketch-books and the Copic Airbrush System.</p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>There are 3 types of Copic markers*: Ciao, Sketch and Classic. All our markers are made in Japan and
                    evaluated against the highest quality standards, they are all refillable with Copic Ink and feature
                    replaceable premium quality nibs. What differs is the overall design, colors available, the type of
                    nib
                    used and the amount of ink in the markers. Copic Sketch and Classic are compatible with the Copic
                    Air
                    Brush System. Feel free to choose the type most suitable to your creative needs. Copic Sketch: our
                    global bestseller with an oval ergonomic design and color coded caps, comes with the flexible super
                    brush nib and a medium broad nib. Available in 358 colors and is the preferred choice among many
                    creative professionals in design, illustration and Manga. Copic Ciao: an introductory marker with a
                    more
                    accessible price point. It has a simpler design and a lower quantity of ink. Features the same nibs
                    as
                    Sketch and is available in 180 colors. Copic Classic: the original model created in 1987 with an
                    iconic
                    square design and color coded caps, features a broad nib and a fine nib. Available in 214 colors and
                    used mainly in architecture, design and graphic illustrations. *Copic Wide is only available as an
                    empty
                    marker which you can fill with your choice of Copic Ink.</p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Copic has its own color system based on which we assign the names of the markers. The letters
                    represent
                    a rough hue (dominant color family, e.g. R stands for 'red', B for 'blue' and 'E' for earth colors).
                    The
                    first digit expresses the saturation of the color - the closer the digit is to 0, the more
                    transparent
                    it is. On the other hand, digits closer to 9 mean that the color is rather dull or muddy. The final
                    digits represent brightness with 000 being the brightest and 9 being the darkest.</p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>With one Copic Multiliner you can draw a line with the following approximate length*: 0.03 / 0.05 /
                    0.1: 1,200m 0.3: 1,000m 0.5: 700m 0.8/1.0: 500m * The above data will vary depending on various
                    factors such as the pressure and speed applied in use, absorption properties of the paper,
                    temperature, and humidity, so please consider it as a rough guide only.</p>

            </label>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="fifth">
            <div class="answers">
                <p>The ink in our Black Multiliner is made of carbon black pigment ink, which is similar to the ink used
                    by other brands in this category. Since our standard value is also obtained by measurement with a
                    densitometer, the ink itself is not particularly light. If you use Multiliners with a very thin nib,
                    such as 0.03 and 0.05, the ink may appear light due to the thinness of the lines.</p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>It seems that a strange odor sometimes occurs when yeast adheres to the lubricating oil, which is
                    applied to the cap to make opening and closing Multiliners smoother. We are very sorry for this
                    inconvenience. You can remove the odor by wiping the part of the liner which touches the inside of
                    the cap with a tissue soaked in alcohol. Products shipped after 2017 have been improved, so the
                    issue is now under control, but if it happens with a newly purchased product, we will replace it.

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Since our ink is dye based it behaves differently from pigment ink when applied on paper, pigments
                    stay on the surface while dyes soak into it. This is why the colors achieved with dye inks appear
                    slightly different, even if you use the same color it may look more vivid or dull depending on the
                    paper used. We recommend trying out some of our paper types to evaluate which one is most suitable
                    for your practice.</p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Various types of paper can be used such as regular copy paper, manga manuscript paper, construction
                    paper, drawing paper or watercolor paper. The finish and comfort of drawing may differ depending on
                    which one you use though so we recommend you first try out a few varieties. If you are new to
                    illustration, we recommend the Premium Bond Paper and Custom Paper from Copic Paper Selections, they
                    both prevent ink from spreading too much.</p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Gasen-shi is a general term for paper used in calligraphy. It is very easy to achieve a soft finish
                    with this surface since the ink easily soaks into it which also makes the paper suitable for ink
                    painting. To best enjoy the characteristics of Gasen-shi without worrying about the bleed-throughs,
                    we offer our own Gasen-shi (Soft Watercolor Paper), which is fully bleed-proof allowing you to draw
                    on both sides of the paper. The range of expression expands when it is used in combination with the
                    Super Brush featured in Copic Sketch and Ciao. (Also available as a custom nib for Copic Classic).

                    needs. Premium Bond Paper: slightly off-white in tone, bleed-proof and therefore recommended for
                    beginners. Custom Paper: very white, provides vibrant expression of color and does not bleed. PM
                    Paper: developed for design drawings, bleed-proof, recommended to use with colored pencils and
                    pastels. Thick Marker Paper: provides vibrant expression of color, easy to create gradations.
                    Gasen-shi: bleed-proof, texture similar to Japanese washi paper, suitable for watercolor-style
                    artworks. Apart from A4 packs, we also carry papers in smaller sizes and sketchbooks.

                    Generally speaking, if you store the Copic markers correctly and refill them properly, you will be
                    able to use them for a very long time. All Copic markers also feature replaceable nibs and can be
                    renewed, so feel free to replace them as needed when you feel the drawing comfort changed. That
                    being said, since Copic markers are made of plastic, they will deteriorate over time. Because of
                    that we ask you not to store them in direct sunlight (or fluorescent light) and high temperature and
                    humidity.</p>

                <p>Copic markers: Please remember the markers are made to last and by refilling with Copic Ink and
                    replacing worn nibs you can keep them for many years. If you want to dispose a worn or damaged
                    marker then make sure to treat it as non-burnable waste. Copic Ink refills (Various Ink): firstly
                    clean out any remaining ink by wiping it on a paper towel in a well-ventilated room and out of reach
                    of fire. You can then dispose of the cap and vessel as recyclable materials (please double check
                    local guidelines in your market) Copic Airbrush Set (ABS): Make sure you have used up its contents
                    and then dispose of it in the same way you would treat a general spray can according to the disposal
                    guidnace of your local government.
